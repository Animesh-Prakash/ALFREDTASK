Key Features
Question and Answer Format: The app uses the flashcard format, which is a well-known method for active recall.
Levels for Spaced Repetition: Flashcards can be categorized by difficulty (level). This allows users to review harder cards more frequently while giving easier cards less attention.
Editable and Deletable Cards: Users should be able to easily modify or remove cards as their knowledge evolves.
Design Choices
Simple UI: The interface is kept clean and user-friendly. Flashcards are displayed with large text for easy reading. The flip animation is used to display the answer in a visually appealing manner.
Responsiveness: The app is responsive, making it suitable for use on mobile and desktop.
Interactive Elements: Buttons like "I know it" and "I donâ€™t know it" add a layer of interactivity, which gives the app a more dynamic and engaging experience for users.
Spaced Repetition Algorithm: Implementing a true spaced repetition system (like Anki) to automate card review frequency based on user performance.
User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, so they can save their progress and sync their flashcards across devices.
Progress Tracking: Track how well users are doing with their flashcards and provide detailed insights.
